# 🦟 Mosquito Repellent & Fragrance Diffuser Circuit

A low-power dual-purpose electronic system designed to both repel mosquitoes using ultrasonic signals and diffuse a pleasant fragrance, offering an affordable and health-conscious solution for enclosed indoor spaces.



# 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to combine pest control and air quality enhancement in a compact and cost-effective design. The system generates ultrasonic frequencies known to deter mosquitoes while heating a scent reservoir or using a fan mechanism to diffuse fragrance.



# 🧩 Key Features

1. 🦟 Mosquito Repellent
2. Emits ultrasonic signals (typically 20–40 kHz)

   Designed to disturb mosquito nervous systems without harming humans

   Analog frequency generator using op-amps and passive components


2. 🌸 Fragrance Diffusion
    Optional heating element or fan-based aroma dispersal

   Can be paired with essential oils or solid fragrance modules

   Powered by the same low-voltage circuit


3. ⚡ Low Power Consumption
   Operates on <12V DC, suitable for USB or battery power

   Efficient analog circuitry avoids need for microcontroller

4. 💡 Compact & Cost-Effective
   Designed for home, office, or indoor public space use

   Simple, affordable component selection





# 🧠 Tech Stack & Tools

       Analog Circuit Design (op-amps, timers, transistors)

       PCB Design (using KiCad / EasyEDA / Altium – mention which one used)

       Prototyping & Testing (breadboard validation and enclosure testing)


# 🧑‍💻 Project Leadership

    Led a small team of engineers and designers from initial concept through:

    Research and feasibility analysis

    Circuit simulation and prototyping

    PCB layout and assembly

    Final functional prototype
